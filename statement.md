This project detects room occupancy by identifying motion through a webcam. It processes video frames, highlights movement, and displays real-time status with timestamps. Designed for students, developers, and small spaces, it offers simple surveillance with features like frame differencing, contour detection, bounding boxes, and activity logging—fast, lightweight, and easy to understand.
Problem Statement: Detect room occupancy using real-time motion detection.
Scope: Frame processing, motion identification, status display, logging.
Target Users: Students, developers, small businesses, home users.
High-Level Features: Live video capture, grayscale/blur preprocessing, frame differencing, contour detection, bounding boxes, occupancy status, timestamps, and activity log.
